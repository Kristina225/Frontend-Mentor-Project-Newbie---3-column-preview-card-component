## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I got to practice flexbox and the box-model with this challenge.
I also learned how to not to have a line-break with words that contain hyphens.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow - No line break after hyphen](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7691569/no-line-break-after-a-hyphen) - This helped me learn how to not to have a line-break with words that contain hyphens. I just replace the hyphen with a non-breaking hyphen '&#8209;'.
